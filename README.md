Implementations of some common algorithms in Java - Maven

The TrappingRainWater.java was a fun one and a little pat my back moment as it is in the top 3% of speed ("Your runtime beats 97.87 % of java submissions") and one of the lowest memory usage on leetcode.com (https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

NOTE: there is still some code clean up on Binary Tree as Java references are a bit tricky to manage.
